Although this is a project in development, you can see a preview of the tool <a href=http://naicode.tech/san//index.php/Customer/admin>here</a>.

As a project for Stanford's Using Tech for Good class, our team developed an app with a customer and admin-facing side. 
Norah and Thomas developed an SMS app to register or request/reschedule an emptying service, while Yue and Janel built
an admin web tool to facilitate back-end operations like managing customer data and scheduling waste collection services by request.
